					<p>How did this fascinating idea enter into existence, you ask?  Well, it may sound a bit cliché, but it all started with a dream.  A dream to one day be able to provide necessities and beyond to those less fortunate, both locally and around the world.  
					Having grown up in a small village in Haiti, Edler Destinas, CEO of dollarbid, LLC. knows firsthand what it means to be less fortunate.  “Not many Haitian children know what it means to have a dream.  Planning for the future usually means hoping that there is enough food for tomorrow’s meals”, says Destinas.  He continues, “This is why I feel compelled, called to be successful in business, allowing me the opportunity to give back to those communities in need.”</p>
					
					<p>Becoming a United States citizen was the first step on the road to making this dream a reality.  While in the U.S., living the American Dream, Edler Destinas’ heart of service landed him in the United States Army.  Traveling the country, the world and being immersed in many different cultures, flashbacks tend to flood Destinas’ mind.  Remembering and seeing the depth of poverty that millions continue to experience both locally and globally.  These experiences strengthen the want and need to show compassion and DO SOMETHING about it.  These difficult and challenging societal times heighten the validity of NEEDING to bring this dream to life.”</p>
					
					<p>Having an extreme interest in Information Technology, Computer……., Destinas began coursework to receive his Master’s Degree.  To increase knowledge of ever-changing online marketplaces was the goal of this course.  While researching, brainstorming and preparing for a thesis in this course, the idea, and premise of dollarbid, LLC. was born.  "It is exciting to be able to offer a fun alternative to shopping as we have known it for so long", says Destinas.  He adds, "Most rewarding, though, is knowing that my dream has now been given life.  Every single dollarbid customer has played an integral role in this reality.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart."</p>
