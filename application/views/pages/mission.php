					<p>Imagine this:</p>
					
					<p>You are searching online to find a gift or an item you need or want.  The only thing on your mind is your budget, "I cannot go above my budget" you whisper to yourself.  Due to effective marketing, edgy design and the proper placements of ads and banners, you click on an ad that catches your eye.  You are immediately attracted to the creative nature of this dollarbid, LLC. ideology.  You cannot believe that it is only ONE DOLLAR to bid!  "ONE DOLLAR?" you accidentally shout out loud!  As you scroll through the categories of items offered to bid on, for ONE DOLLAR, you are blown away by the integrity of these items.  "High-end" you think to yourself, "why wouldn't I bid ONE DOLLAR, with the opportunity to win? Maybe I will go ahead and bid on a bunch of these items, a better chance at winning something and I will still be under budget.  And perhaps I will win even more than once!"  As you are deciding which items to bid on, you cannot keep your eye off of this one product.  You keep scrolling back to it.  You NEED this...NOW!  To your surprise, you notice that there is an option to purchase the item without having to go through the bidding process, at a fraction of the product's cost.  SOLD! "Wow", you exclaim, "this is the best of both worlds, I just can't go wrong!"  As you are about to check out, you notice a third option.  “I can make an offer?” you quietly ask yourself.  “I sure can”, as you type away, entering the dollar figure you calculated in your mind.  At this point you are having a conversation with yourself, wondering how it is possible that you are in control.  You feel as though you just cannot lose no matter which way you look at it.  Now that is what we call customer satisfaction, and we are here to serve you!:</p>
